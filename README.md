# Projet6
Standford dogs breed classification

Classification of images using Deep Learning

1/ Creation of a custom algorithm from scratch in Keras
- Data Augmentation
- Tuning of hyperparameters

2/ Transfer learning
- ResNet50
- Xception

The project is splitted in 3 notebooks, because I used 3 working environements :

- Local laptop : testing several models on complete data
- Google colab : testing several models on a data sample
- AWS Sagemaker : execution of the final model

The notebook Projet6_prediction contains a simple function to read, process and predict a dog breed from a custom image.

The .pdf file contains a presentation of my project in French.
